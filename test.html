            <h2>Lucia</h2>
            <p>Lucia Caminos learned to fight before she could walk — her father made sure of it. Life's been throwing punches ever since. Defending her family landed her in Leonida Penitentiary, but sheer luck set her free. She's done with mistakes. Now it's all calculated moves, ambition, and the dream of the good life her mom envisioned since their Liberty City days. With Jason by her side, she might finally take control — or burn it all down trying.</p>

            <h2>Jason</h2>
            <p>Jason Duval wants the easy life, but trouble keeps finding him. Raised around grifters and crooks, he joined the Army to escape his past — only to end up running with drug crews in the Leonida Keys. Sharp, steady, and lethal when cornered, he's ready for a change. Meeting Lucia might be the best thing that's ever happened to him... or the worst. Either way, he's all in — for now, it's hard to tell how this ride ends.</p>

            <h2>Dre'Quan Preist</h2>
            <p>Dre'Quan was never built for the streets — he was always more hustler than gangster. Dealing kept the lights on, but music was the real dream. Now running Only Raw Records with Boobie Ike, he's signed viral duo Real Dimez and left the strip club bookings behind. The Vice City scene is his next target. One breakout hit could turn his grind into legacy — if the past doesn't drag him back first.</p>

            <h2>Stefanie</h2>
            <p>Stefanie works as a social worker for the Leonida Department of Corrections, staring down the system's deep cracks every day. She's seen too many lives chewed up and spit out — and she's tired of watching it happen. With quiet determination and insider knowledge, she's ready to bend the rules her own way. In a world of corruption, she's the one trying to fix things... even if it means getting her hands dirty.</p>

            <h2>Cal Hampton</h2>
            <p>Jason's loyal friend and fellow associate of Brian Heder. Cal feels safest locked away at home, cracking open beers while scanning Coast Guard comms and diving deep into private tabs. The world's run by psychopaths, he says — and he's fine riding the low tide of America. Casual paranoia is his comfort zone, but with Jason chasing bigger scores, Cal might get dragged into the storm whether he likes it or not.</p>

            <h2>Boobie Ike</h2>
            <p>A true Vice City legend who acts the part. Boobie turned brutal street years into a gleaming empire: real estate, the infamous Jack of Hearts strip club, and a recording studio. All smiles and Hawaiian shirts on the surface — but when business hits the table, the charm drops fast. His partnership with Dre'Quan on Only Raw Records is where his real focus lies now. One killer track could cement his legacy... or expose the foundations it's built on.</p>

            <h2>Real Dimez</h2>
            <p>Bae-Luxe and Roxy — high school best friends turned viral sensations as Real Dimez. They flipped street smarts and dealer shake-downs into bold lyrics and relentless social media heat. Their breakout collab with DWNPLY lit up the scene, but five years and endless drama later, momentum's fading. Signed to Only Raw Records, they're desperate to prove they're more than a one-hit wonder. One more banger could own Vice City — or leave them forgotten in the feed.</p>

            <h2>Raul Bautista</h2>
            <p>Confidence, charm, and cold calculation — Raul Bautista is a veteran bank robber who's pulled off more scores than most dream of. Always scouting fresh talent for the next big risk, he thrives on the edge where one wrong move ends everything. Reckless when the adrenaline hits, but dangerously precise when it counts. In Vice City's high-stakes game, Raul's the one holding the cards... until the house decides to collect.</p>

            <h2>Brian Heder</h2>
            <p>A classic drug runner from the golden era of Keys smuggling — tan, grinning, and still very much in the game. Brian lets younger crews handle the heavy lifting these days while he oversees from afar, landlord to Jason and associate to Cal. Old-school methods, iron loyalty, and zero patience for amateurs. His empire floats quietly, but cross him and the tide turns fast — and it rarely comes back in.</p>

            <h2>Luxe</h2>
            <p>Bae-Luxe — one half of Real Dimez — Vice City's sharpest glow-up story. From shaking down dealers to viral fame, she and Roxy built an empire on grit, bars, and unapologetic confidence. Signed to Only Raw, Luxe's chasing the next level: bigger stages, bigger checks, bigger stakes. The streets gave her the hunger — now she's starving for the throne. One wrong verse, though, and it all crashes back to zero.</p>
